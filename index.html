	This website is designed for meeeting the minimum requirements
	for Lab-3a of the course Internals of Application Servers (IAS).
	It has only two pages: the landing page that you're seeing now 
	and an about page, that's accessible the clicking the "About me"
	link on the top-right corner. <br/>
	The course itself is going to focus on serverless architecture.
	Serverless architectures refer to applications that significantly 
	depend on third-party services (knows as Backend as a Service or 
	"BaaS") or on custom code that's run in ephemeral containers 
	(Function as a Service or "FaaS"), the best known vendor host of 
	which currently is AWS Lambda. By using these ideas, and by moving 
	much behavior to the front end, such architectures remove the need 
	for the traditional 'always on' server system sitting behind an 
	application.
